These archives are generated using LH/2 v2.22 for OS/2:

 * lh0.lzh       - Uncompressed (stored) file using -lh0- scheme
 * lh5.lzh       - Compressed file using -lh5- scheme
 * readonly.lzh  - File attributes preserved using /a option
 * sfx.exe       - Self-extracting archive
 * subdir.lzh    - File in multiple levels of subdirectories
 * eas.lzh       - File with extended attributes
 * easubdir.lzh  - File in subdirectories that have extended attributes

The EA test archives store the extended attributes in separate directory
entries and the LH2 has some special handling for these. How it identifies
them as special is currently unclear. We probably ought to have special
handling to skip over them, as it causes problems with directories being
extracted as files instead of directories.
